'description': """Rules for Recursive CTEs
A recursive CTE is self-referencing (has a reference to itself)
A recursive CTE is a UNION of recursive and non-recursive members:
At least one non-recursive member (anchor) must be present
Non-recursive members are placed first in the UNION
Recursive members are separated from anchor members and from one another with UNION ALL clauses, i.e.,
   non-recursive member (anchor)
    UNION [ALL | DISTINCT]
    non-recursive member (anchor)
    UNION [ALL | DISTINCT]
    non-recursive member (anchor)
    UNION ALL
    recursive member
    UNION ALL
    recursive member

References between CTEs should not have loops
Aggregates (DISTINCT, GROUP BY, HAVING) and aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, MAX etc) are not allowed in recursive members
A recursive member can have only one reference to itself and only in a FROM clause
A recursive reference cannot participate in an outer join""",
